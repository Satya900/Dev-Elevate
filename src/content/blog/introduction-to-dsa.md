# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the foundation of computer science and software development. In this article, we'll explore the fundamental concepts that every programmer should know.

## What are Data Structures?

Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data that make it easier to modify, navigate, and access. They determine how data is collected, the functions we can use to access it, and the relationships between data.

## Why are Algorithms Important?

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving specific problems. They're essential because they help us:
- Process data efficiently
- Save time and resources
- Solve complex problems systematically

## Getting Started

To begin your DSA journey, focus on these fundamental concepts:
1. Time and Space Complexity
2. Basic Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists)
3. Searching and Sorting Algorithms
