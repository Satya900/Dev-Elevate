# Understanding Binary Trees and BST

Binary trees are hierarchical data structures where each node has at most two children. Let's explore their implementation and common operations.

## Binary Search Tree Implementation

```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

class BinarySearchTree {
    constructor() {
        this.root = null;
    }
    
    insert(value) {
        const newNode = new Node(value);
        if (!this.root) {
            this.root = newNode;
            return;
        }
        
        let current = this.root;
        while (true) {
            if (value < current.value) {
                if (!current.left) {
                    current.left = newNode;
                    break;
                }
                current = current.left;
            } else {
                if (!current.right) {
                    current.right = newNode;
                    break;
                }
                current = current.right;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
