# Mastering Linked Lists: Implementation and Common Operations

Linked Lists are fundamental data structures that consist of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Let's dive deep into understanding and implementing them.

## Basic Structure

A Linked List node typically looks like this in JavaScript:

```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

class LinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
    }
}
```

## Core Operations

### 1. Insertion

Here's how to insert a new node at different positions:

```javascript
// Insert at beginning
insertAtBeginning(data) {
    const newNode = new Node(data);
    newNode.next = this.head;
    this.head = newNode;
}

// Insert at end
insertAtEnd(data) {
    const newNode = new Node(data);
    
    if (!this.head) {
        this.head = newNode;
        return;
    }
    
    let current = this.head;
    while (current.next) {
        current = current.next;
    }
    current.next = newNode;
}
```

### 2. Deletion

Common deletion operations:

```javascript
// Delete first node
deleteFirst() {
    if (!this.head) return;
    this.head = this.head.next;
}

// Delete last node
deleteLast() {
    if (!this.head) return;
    
    if (!this.head.next) {
        this.head = null;
        return;
    }
    
    let current = this.head;
    while (current.next.next) {
        current = current.next;
    }
    current.next = null;
}
```

## Common Interview Problems

### 1. Detecting a Cycle

One of the most common interview questions is detecting a cycle in a linked list:

```javascript
hasCycle() {
    let slow = this.head;
    let fast = this.head;
    
    while (fast && fast.next) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
        
        if (slow === fast) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

### 2. Reversing a Linked List

Another popular problem is reversing a linked list:

```javascript
reverse() {
    let prev = null;
    let current = this.head;
    
    while (current) {
        let next = current.next;
        current.next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }
    
    this.head = prev;
}
```

## Time Complexity Analysis

Here's a breakdown of time complexities for common operations:

- Insertion at beginning: O(1)
- Insertion at end: O(n)
- Deletion at beginning: O(1)
- Deletion at end: O(n)
- Search: O(n)

## Practice Problems

To master linked lists, try solving these problems:

1. Implement a method to find the middle node
2. Merge two sorted linked lists
3. Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list
4. Check if a linked list is a palindrome

## Conclusion

Linked Lists are essential data structures that often appear in technical interviews. Understanding their implementation and common operations is crucial for any programmer. Practice these concepts regularly to build strong problem-solving skills.

Remember:
- Always handle edge cases (empty list, single node)
- Consider both iterative and recursive solutions
- Think about space and time complexity
- Practice visualization of pointer manipulation
