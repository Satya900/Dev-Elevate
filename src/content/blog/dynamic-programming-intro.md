# Introduction to Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. In this article, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of dynamic programming and how to apply them.

## What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method. The term was coined by Richard Bellman in the 1950s. The main idea behind dynamic programming is quite simple:

1. Break down a complex problem into simpler subproblems
2. Solve these subproblems only once and store their solutions
3. Use these stored solutions to avoid redundant computations

## Key Concepts

### 1. Overlapping Subproblems

A problem has overlapping subproblems if solving it requires solving the same subproblems multiple times. For example, in the Fibonacci sequence, calculating fib(5) requires calculating fib(4) and fib(3), and calculating fib(4) requires calculating fib(3) again.

### 2. Optimal Substructure

A problem has optimal substructure if its optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems. For example, the shortest path problem has optimal substructure because the shortest path between two vertices contains other shortest paths within it.

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Memoization (Top-Down)

```javascript
function fibonacci(n, memo = {}) {
    if (n in memo) return memo[n];
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    
    memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo);
    return memo[n];
}
```

### 2. Tabulation (Bottom-Up)

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    
    let dp = new Array(n + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = 1;
    
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Common Dynamic Programming Problems

1. Fibonacci Sequence
2. Longest Common Subsequence
3. Knapsack Problem
4. Matrix Chain Multiplication
5. Shortest Path Problems

## When to Use Dynamic Programming?

Use dynamic programming when your problem has these characteristics:

1. Overlapping subproblems
2. Optimal substructure
3. The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems

## Tips for Solving DP Problems

1. Identify if the problem can be solved using DP
2. Find the recurrence relation
3. Decide the state representation
4. Code either top-down or bottom-up approach
5. Optimize space complexity if needed

## Practice Problems

Try solving these problems to strengthen your understanding:

1. Climbing Stairs
2. Coin Change
3. Longest Increasing Subsequence
4. Edit Distance
5. Maximum Subarray Sum

## Conclusion

Dynamic Programming is a powerful technique that can help solve complex problems efficiently. Practice is key to mastering DP - start with simple problems and gradually move to more complex ones.
