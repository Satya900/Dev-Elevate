# Essential Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms are crucial for finding elements in data structures. Let's explore various searching techniques and their implementations.

## Binary Search

```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;
        if (arr[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
        else right = mid - 1;
    }
    
    return -1;
}
```
