# Mastering Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is a technique used to perform operations at the bit level. This can lead to faster and more efficient algorithms for certain problems.

## Basic Operations

```javascript
// Check if number is even
function isEven(n) {
    return (n & 1) === 0;
}

// Get bit at position
function getBit(num, position) {
    return (num & (1 << position)) !== 0;
}

// Set bit at position
function setBit(num, position) {
    return num | (1 << position);
}

// Clear bit at position
function clearBit(num, position) {
    return num & ~(1 << position);
}
```
