# Graph Algorithms and Applications

Graphs are versatile data structures used to represent relationships between objects. This article covers essential graph algorithms and their implementations.

## Graph Implementation

```javascript
class Graph {
    constructor() {
        this.adjacencyList = {};
    }
    
    addVertex(vertex) {
        if (!this.adjacencyList[vertex]) {
            this.adjacencyList[vertex] = [];
        }
    }
    
    addEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
        this.adjacencyList[vertex1].push(vertex2);
        this.adjacencyList[vertex2].push(vertex1);
    }
    
    removeEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
        this.adjacencyList[vertex1] = this.adjacencyList[vertex1]
            .filter(v => v !== vertex2);
        this.adjacencyList[vertex2] = this.adjacencyList[vertex2]
            .filter(v => v !== vertex1);
    }
}
```
