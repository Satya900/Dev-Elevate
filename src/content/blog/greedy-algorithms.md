# Understanding Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While they don't always yield the best solution, they often provide good approximations and are typically easier to implement and faster than other approaches.

## What are Greedy Algorithms?

A greedy algorithm follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each step. In many cases, this strategy may lead to globally optimal solutions, but this is not guaranteed for all problems.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Greedy Choice Property**: A global optimum can be reached by making locally optimal choices
2. **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems

## Common Examples

### 1. Coin Change Problem (with specific denominations)

```javascript
function coinChange(amount, coins) {
    coins.sort((a, b) => b - a); // Sort in descending order
    let result = [];
    
    for (let coin of coins) {
        while (amount >= coin) {
            result.push(coin);
            amount -= coin;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### 2. Activity Selection

```javascript
function activitySelection(start, finish) {
    let activities = [];
    let n = start.length;
    
    // First activity is always selected
    let i = 0;
    activities.push(i);
    
    for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
        if (start[j] >= finish[i]) {
            activities.push(j);
            i = j;
        }
    }
    
    return activities;
}
```

## Common Applications

1. **Huffman Coding**: Data compression
2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Shortest path in a graph
3. **Prim's Algorithm**: Minimum spanning tree
4. **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Minimum spanning tree
5. **Job Scheduling**: Maximizing profit or minimizing time

## When to Use Greedy Algorithms?

Use greedy algorithms when:

1. The problem has optimal substructure
2. A locally optimal choice leads to a globally optimal solution
3. You need a fast solution and an approximate result is acceptable

## Implementation Tips

1. Sort input data if needed
2. Make the locally optimal choice at each step
3. Verify that the solution is feasible
4. Test with various input cases

## Practice Problems

1. Fractional Knapsack
2. Job Sequencing
3. Minimum Platforms
4. Huffman Encoding
5. Maximum Meetings in a Room

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- Simple to implement
- Usually very efficient
- Often provide good approximations

### Disadvantages
- May not always find the optimal solution
- Can be difficult to prove correctness
- Not suitable for all optimization problems

## Conclusion

Greedy algorithms are powerful tools when used appropriately. Understanding when to use them and their limitations is crucial for effective problem-solving in computer science.
