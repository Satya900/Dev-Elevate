# Essential Array Algorithms and Techniques

Arrays are fundamental data structures that form the basis of many algorithms. This article covers essential array manipulation techniques and common algorithms.

## Two-Pointer Technique

```javascript
function twoSum(array, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = array.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        let sum = array[left] + array[right];
        if (sum === target) return [left, right];
        if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return null;
}
```
